# Toy Robot Coding Test

I thought I'd do the toy robot coding test in JavaScript to get a bit of practice in.

## How to test & run

I have created tests with Jest. You can run them with `npm run test`

You can send commands to the robot by adjusting code in `playground.js` and then running `node playground.js` in your terminal.

## Decisions made

I decided to use the prototype chain in JS rather than build a class with ES6. This was just to make sure I can still understand the old way of doing it and how `class` works behind the scenes in JS.
